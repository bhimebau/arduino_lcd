# TFT Display
The [TFTP Display Wiki](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/2.8%27%27_TFT_Touch_Shield_v2.0) provides a great deal of background information on the display/touch screen. 

Libraries - download as zip files and copy to your Arduino/libraries Folder (see wiki above for additional detail). *Once the library files are copyed, you will need to restart the Arduino IDE for the files to be recognized.*

TFT and Touch Screen Examples: Note that there are working example included in **File->Examples**  

### Development Challenges
  * Problem 1: Create a program that moves a circle around the edges of the screen. Try to make the motion of the circle as smooth as possible.  
  * Problem 2: Create a program that generates the IU logo.
  * Problem 3: Create a program that allow you to move a rectangle to a location on the screen specified by the touch of a user. 
  * Problem 4: Extend your solution to Problem 3 by changing the color of the rectangle based on how hard the user is pressing on the screen. See the [TFTP Display Wiki Draw Circle](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/2.8''_TFT_Touch_Shield_V2.0#drawCircle:) explanation for more information on how to generate specific colors. 
  * Problem 5: Modify the provided pong example code to change the color of the ball after a collision with the paddle.
  * Problem 6: Display a running count of the number of times that the ball has collided with the:
     * paddle
     * walls
